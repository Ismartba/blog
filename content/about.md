Hola! I'm Isaac, a project manager currently pivoting my career towards data analysis and IT. My passion is using data-driven insights to solve business problems and streamline operations. With a solid foundation in finance & project management, business strategy, and international experience (especially in Southeast Asia), I'm excited to bring a fresh perspective to the tech world.  

* I have a track record of guiding teams,  executing successful projects, and simplifying complex information for decision-makers.

* My professional journey has taken me across continents, allowing me to navigate diverse environments and multicultural teams. This adaptability is an asset I bring to any team.

* I'm fascinated by technology trends and their potential to change how we work. Currently, I'm learning Python, R, and tools like Power BI to further expand my data analysis skills. 

* **'Projectopython' is my playground:**  Through this website, I'll share my learning journey, document projects, and explore the intersection of data and project management.

Feel free to connect with me if you're interested in data analysis, project management, or international business. 

Always open to collaborations and knowledge sharing!
